Uh, the moshpit real toxic
I got too much profit
I got too much profit
I got too much profit
Uh, the moshpit real toxic
I got too much profit
I got too much profit (Lil' Carti, lil' Carti)
I got too much profit

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
The moshpit real toxic
I got too much profit
I got too much profit
I got too much profit
The moshpit real toxic
I got too much profit
I got too much profit
I got too much profit

[Verse 2: Skepta]
I study the streets, how you gonna go to war with a genius?
This ain't community servicе, but I came in with them street sweepers
Your boyfriеnd is a follower, why don't you come roll with the leaders?
She told me she loves me, ha, woah, I told her I'm speechless
I'm The Omen, heart is frozen, if it ain't fam', I got no emotions
Like poker, when I poke 'em, boy, I just Texas hold 'em
We got the club goin' up like Makonnen
Everyday, we're cashin' 'em checks, Big Smoke, you know the slogan
I need a million dollars, I need a million euros
I need a million pound, your wifey ringin' me down
She said I was trash, you're feelin' me now
Uh, Playboi, tell 'em, I broke America, big in the east
I'm big in the west, I'm big in the south
Big racks, they jump out the house
[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
The moshpit real toxic
I got too much profit
I got too much profit
I got too much profit
Uh, the moshpit real toxic
I got too much profit
I got too much profit
I got too much profit
